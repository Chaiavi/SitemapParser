SitemapParser
=============

**Simple Java Tool to Parse any Online Sitemap**

The tool parses all sorts of Sitemaps, including zipped ones and even sitemap Indexes (recursive parsing).
Just send a URL of an online sitemap and you will get all of its content

This tool basically uses [CrawlerCommons](https://code.google.com/p/crawler-commons/) Sitemap functionality - they did the heavy lifting of the sitemap parsing, I just created a wrapper tool which can easily run and do the work.


#### Usage:
Java -jar SitemapParser v0.6.jar [URL OF A SITEMAP]
