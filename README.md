SitemapParser
=============

Simple Java Tool to Parse any Online Sitemap

The tool parses all sorts of Sitemaps, including zipped ones and even sitemap Indexes (recursive parsing).

Just send a URL of an online sitemap and you will get all of it's content

This tool basically uses CrawlerCommons Sitemap functionality - they did the heavy lifting of the sitemap parsing.
