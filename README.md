# 🗺️ SitemapParser

**A simple Java tool to parse any online sitemap.**

---

## Overview

SitemapParser handles all types of sitemaps — including compressed (`.gz`) sitemaps and **Sitemap Index files** with full recursive parsing. Just provide a URL and get all the sitemap content back.

> Built on top of [Crawler Commons](https://code.google.com/p/crawler-commons/) sitemap functionality. They did the heavy lifting of sitemap parsing — this project wraps it into an easy-to-use command-line tool.

## ⚙️ Logging Configuration

SitemapParser uses **SLF4J** as its logging API with **Logback** as the implementation.

To customize the log output, edit the `logback.xml` configuration file included in the release zip, then run with:

```bash
java -Dlogback.configurationFile=logback.xml -jar SitemapParser_v0.6.jar [URL]
```
